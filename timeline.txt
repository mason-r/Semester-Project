This is a timeline of all events in my project. This is not vital information and is for reference purposes only. You are not required to read all of this, and frankly it probably isn't worth your time anyway.

8/19/21: Beginning of project. Brainstorm document created. Many things planned: overall concepts, modification options, score changers, and more.
8/25/21: Added a list of songs I want to add. Notable examples include the planned hardest song Hello (BPM) 2021 by Camellia and the obligatory Freedom Dive.
8/27/21 (1): Completed prototype note shapes. Default notes are simple blue circles with dark blue border; anti-notes are very dark red with a dripping effect.
8/27/21 (2): Scrapped prototype note shapes because the program I used turned out to be really bad for making graphics.
8/27/21 (3): Began experimenting with vector graphics software. Default note finished since it's literally just two circles.
8/30/21 (1): Finished prototype notes with vector graphics this time. Planning on adding more detail.
8/30/21 (2): Added a skull to anti-note prototype. It looks sick and I'm proud of myself.
8/30/21 (3): Changed default notes to four different colors: blue, red, green, and yellow.
9/1/21: Presented game idea to the class. Reception was overall positive with several questions. Mr. Jones was especially interested in Hello (BPM) 2021.
9/3/21: Began actual software development. Game is currently being created in GameMaker Studio 2. Progress is extremely slow as I have never used it before.
9/7/21 (1): Wrote first program in GMS. Program checks if key A, S, K, or L is pressed and updates a GUI with the previously pressed key.
9/7/21 (2): Pseudocoded the entire game in Google Docs. Includes settings and credits menu.
9/7/21 (3): Had an epiphany and changed game name to Ready 2 Rock (or R2R). This will likely be the final name.
9/8/21: File containing the note designs has disappeared. I don't know how. The file is just empty. Time to redraw the notes again.
9/9/21: Notes have been redrawn. It took much shorter than the first time. Also added hit areas.
9/10/21: Nothing is working. I can't get any code to run properly. No music is playing. No sprites are drawing. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
9/15/21: Added hit zones. As of now they're just slightly bigger grey circles. I'll probably figure out how to change their color through GMS when a key is pressed.
9/20/21: Gave up on GMS. Switched to coding on Snap. Got a working prototype in minutes. I probably should have used this to begin with.
9/21/21: Charted first "song" (actually just an audio file of me screaming). It was just a test of the random note system but man was it funny
9/22/21: Began charting actual first song. It's a drum cadence called Hubbell Travel Cadence, usually shortened to Hubbell. It's only 30 seconds long so it should be quick.
9/23/21: Charted the first two bars of Hubbell. This is going to be way harder than I thought.
9/24/21 (1): Note that Hubbell is about 30 seconds long and I really want to chart a song that's SIX AND A HALF MINUTES LONG. That's 13 times as long.
9/24/21 (2): Turns out the file for the super long song was too big. I had to make it a mono track to cut the size in half. Now it's small but doesn't sound as good :(
9/24/21 (3): I've discovered a major problem: latency. Any time there are more than like eight notes on the screen it starts slowing down. This could be very bad.
9/24/21 (4): So the aforementioned lag was actually because I had the script creating all the notes open while the game ran, which slowed it down a lot. Oops.
10/4/21: Started charting Happy End of the World. It'll take a super long time to chart so it might be my only song. I'm planning on adding different effects for cool factor.
10/7/21 (1): Going to try and keep a running total of how much I've charted. Currently 8.5 of 387 seconds (2.2%). And this laptop is kind of laggy so the note timings get weirdly offset. I'm hoping it's because the computer lags and not because the BPM system on Snap isn't working properly.
10/7/21 (2): I'm conflicted between adjusting the offset so that it works great on my laptop but isn't synced properly on a better computer. If I'm presenting on my laptop, then I should adjust for the laptop, but what if I'm trying to play it for fun on my PC? Everything will be messed up. And if I add more effects, it'll slow down even more. I guess I'll optimise it for my laptop.
10/8/21 (1): Added basic background effects. Stage starts grey and fades to light blue at a cool time that syncs with a change in the song. 6.2% of charting complete.
10/8/21 (2): BREAKTHROUGH. I figured out how to have nonlinear rotation using for loops with decimal index numbers. It actually looks good. This is incredible.
10/14/21: Took a break and worked on another project until now. Just charted up until first drop. 10.6% complete.
10/19/21: Officially charted the first minute (and one second) of the song. I decided to split up the song into chunks to make playtesting and editing easier. 15.8% complete.
10/22/21: Added more background flashing and charted up until the spotlights show up. Also realized that I should probably set my battery power to max performance. 20.9% complete.
