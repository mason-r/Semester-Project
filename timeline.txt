This is a timeline of all events in my project. This is not vital information and is for reference purposes only. You are not required to read all of this, and frankly it probably isn't worth your time anyway.

8/19/21: Beginning of project. Brainstorm document created. Many things planned: overall concepts, modification options, score changers, and more.
8/25/21: Added a list of songs I want to add. Notable examples include the planned hardest song Hello (BPM) 2021 by Camellia and the obligatory Freedom Dive.
8/27/21 (1): Completed prototype note shapes. Default notes are simple blue circles with dark blue border; anti-notes are very dark red with a dripping effect.
8/27/21 (2): Scrapped prototype note shapes because the program I used turned out to be really bad for making graphics.
8/27/21 (3): Began experimenting with vector graphics software. Default note finished since it's literally just two circles.
8/30/21 (1): Finished prototype notes with vector graphics this time. Planning on adding more detail.
8/30/21 (2): Added a skull to anti-note prototype. It looks sick and I'm proud of myself.
8/30/21 (3): Changed default notes to four different colors: blue, red, green, and yellow.
9/1/21: Presented game idea to the class. Reception was overall positive with several questions. Mr. Jones was especially interested in Hello (BPM) 2021.
9/3/21: Began actual software development. Game is currently being created in GameMaker Studio 2. Progress is extremely slow as I have never used it before.
9/7/21 (1): Wrote first program in GMS. Program checks if key A, S, K, or L is pressed and updates a GUI with the previously pressed key.
9/7/21 (2): Pseudocoded the entire game in Google Docs. Includes settings and credits menu.
9/7/21 (3): Had an epiphany and changed game name to Ready 2 Rock (or R2R). This will likely be the final name.
9/8/21: File containing the note designs has disappeared. I don't know how. The file is just empty. Time to redraw the notes again.
9/9/21: Notes have been redrawn. It took much shorter than the first time. Also added hit areas.
9/10/21: Nothing is working. I can't get any code to run properly. No music is playing. No sprites are drawing. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
9/15/21: Added hit zones. As of now they're just slightly bigger grey circles. I'll probably figure out how to change their color through GMS when a key is pressed.
9/20/21: Gave up on GMS. Switched to coding on Snap. Got a working prototype in minutes. I probably should have used this to begin with.
9/21/21: Charted first "song" (actually just an audio file of me screaming). It was just a test of the random note system but man was it funny
9/22/21: Began charting actual first song. It's a drum cadence called Hubbell Travel Cadence, usually shortened to Hubbell. It's only 30 seconds long so it should be quick.
9/23/21: Charted the first two bars of Hubbell. This is going to be way harder than I thought.
9/24/21: Note that Hubbell is about 30 seconds long and I really want to chart a song that's SIX AND A HALF MINUTES LONG. That's 13 times as long.
